# Description

This is a fairly complete set of icons for Gnome, KDE Plasma and XFCE (including actions, apps, categories, devices, emblems, emotes, mimetypes, places and status), based on the icons and artwork by Paul Davey (Mattahan) (http://www.mattahan.com/). Some of them come from OxayotlTheGreat and his great job with his own remix, Buuf https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1012512)

One of the main points of this theme is to remove as many symbolic icons as possible (that means linking the symbolic icon to the original icon). This is not always possible, especially for certain Gnome icons, because Gnome applies some effects to some icons, which make them look really bad if they are not real symbolic icons.


# Change log

## Version 2.0 2020-08-29

This is a massive update from the previous version, from 2011!
It is not yet complete, and it still has some svgs and pngs from other themes  as "placeholders" for pending icons.

## Version 1.05

- amarok icon update
- added soffice.bin.png (openoffice.org is a headache for correct icons on docks... anyone knows how to get it working with cairo dock?(EDIT: this appears to be a cairo-dock related problem; other docks display the correct icon))
- gnome power manager icons for mouse, keyboard and cell phone with different battery charge levels
- corrected bmp (beep media player) icon
- emerald theme mime type icon (default .desktop sadly points to /usr/share/pixmaps/emerald-theme-manager-icon.png instead of simply emerald-theme-manager-icon.png, won't work by default :/)
- some JACK only apps: qjackctl, jamin, meterbridge, timemachine, jackeq, jack-rack, jack_mixer
- scores icon
- audio-input-microphone for different levels
- cairo-dock icon
- debian-installer-launcher icon (?)
- gnome-ppp and pppoeconf
- turpial, qwit
- maya and mudbox apps (maybe useless under linux/gnome?) (no mimes, sorry, I don't know what file names they should have)
- other seahorse icons (thanks OxayotlTheGreat and great job with Buuf 3.0 https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1012512)


# Version 1.04
- Added specific panel icons definitions

# Version 1.03:

# Version 1.01:
